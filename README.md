# Rustris
Rustris is a familiar Russian block stacking game remade in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, and a sister project to [AnthonyFic's Tetrjs](https://github.com/AnthonyFic-code/AnthonyFic-code.github.io). My eventual goal with this project is to outdo it :)

_...does_ it have a greater focus on aesthetics, sound, and multiple modes?
